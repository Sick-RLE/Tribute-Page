        <p>Twice rose to domestic fame in 2016 with their single "Cheer Up", which charted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, <br> 
            became the best-performing single of the year, and won "Song of the Year" at the Melon Music Awards and Mnet Asian Music Awards. <br>
            Their next single, "TT", from their third EP Twicecoaster: Lane 1, topped the Gaon charts for four consecutive weeks. The EP was <br> 
            the highest selling Korean girl group album of 2016. Within 19 months after debut, Twice had already sold over 1.2 million units <br>
            of their four EPs and special album. As of 2022, the group has sold over 15 million albums cumulatively in South Korea and Japan. <br>
            <br>
            The group debuted in Japan on June 28, 2017, under Warner Music Japan, with the release of a compilation album titled #Twice. The <br>
            album charted at number 2 on the Oricon Albums Chart with the highest first-week album sales by a K-pop artist in Japan in two years. <br>
            It was followed by the release of Twice's first original Japanese maxi single titled "One More Time" in October. Twice became the first <br>
            Korean girl group to earn a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for both an album and CD single <br>
            in the same year. Twice ranked third in the Top Artist category of Billboard Japan's 2017 Year-end Rankings, and in 2019, they became the <br>
            first Korean girl group to embark on a Japanese dome tour.</p>
